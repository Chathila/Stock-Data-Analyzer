    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project requires you to perform a comprehensive analysis of a company's stock data using only the provided data sources and a local LLM. Your analysis should answer the following six questions strictly based on the supplied data and documents—no external data is allowed. All generated answers must be firmly based on the provided data, without any fabricated content. In addition, your logic must be clear, and any attribution of events must be causally linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Provided Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be provided with the following data sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stock Price Data (Json format)\n",
    "* Timeframe: Jan 22 to Feb 5\n",
    "* Fields: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quarterly Earnings Data for the Past Year (Json format)\n",
    "* Contains key financial indicators (e.g., revenue, eps) for each quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full Earnings Transcript Call\n",
    "* The complete transcript of the earnings call, including management discussions and Q&A.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balance Sheet Data for the Past Year (Json format)\n",
    "* Includes assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity information.\n",

    "#### News Articles\n",
    "* Full text of 10 news articles related to the company during the analysis period.\n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "Using the provided data and a local LLM, you need to answer the following six questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the performance of the Tesla stock during this period (Jan 22 to Feb 5)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why did the price increase on Jan 30? Please provide potential factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compared with previous quarters, how is the performance of this quarter?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With unsupervised Full Self Driving scheduled to launch in limited markets like Austin by June, what regulatory challenges does Tesla foresee for a nationwide or international rollout, and how is the company strategically preparing to address these hurdles?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What insights can be concluded from the earnings call?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Which key news events influenced the stock performance, and what insights do they offer?\n",

    "## Project Requirements\n",
    "- #### Data Source Restriction:\n",
    "Only use the provided data and documents. No external data or information is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Answer Generation:\n",
    "All generated answers must strictly be based on the provided data and documents. The LLM should not \"invent\" information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Clear Logic and Causal Relationships:\n",
    "For each question, your answers must clearly demonstrate logical reasoning, and any attribution of cause must be explicitly linked to events in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Prompt Design:\n",
    "You must design your own prompts for calling the local LLM to ensure that the responses are generated strictly based on the analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Result Evaluation:\n",
    "After generating the answers, implement an evaluation step to assess whether the responses meet the above requirements in terms of data reliance, logical clarity, and correct causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Please put the answers to these 6 questions in a dict at the end of your submitted Python nodebook file.\n",

For example, on January 22, the stock closed just below its opening, showing a slight dip. On February 3, it dropped further, possibly due to earnings reports or geopolitical issues.\n",

       "From the data, we observe the following key points:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Overall Decline**: The stock experienced a net decline of approximately 1.35% over the period, moving from $416.81 on January 22 to $378.17 on February 5.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Key Days of Decline**:\n",
       "   - **January 22**: The stock closed just below its opening price, indicating a small dip.\n",
       "   - **February 3**: The stock dropped significantly, likely due to earnings reports or market sentiment.\n",
       "   - **February 5**: The stock experienced another sharp decline, possibly influenced by geopolitical tensions or corporate earnings.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Percentage Changes**:\n",
       "   - The stock showed mixed performance, with some days experiencing increases (e.g., February 30) and others seeing significant declines (e.g., January 29, 30, and 31).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Trading Volume**: The trading volume remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting that the stock was less liquid during this time.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Volume Fluctuations**: There were notable spikes in trading volume on certain days, such as February 3, where the stock closed near its lowest price.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Causal Insights  \n",
       "\n",
       "While the stock declined, several potential causal factors could explain these movements:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Earnings Reports**: Tesla's earnings report on February 3 may have impacted investor sentiment, leading to a decline in stock price.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Market Sentiment**: The sudden drop in stock price on February 3 could have caused market panic, reducing investor confidence and driving the price lower.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Geopolitical Events**: The rise of China's influence in the U.S. could have affected Tesla's operations and profitability, potentially leading to a decline in stock price.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Corporation Strategy**: Tesla's decision to increase production or expand its global presence may have contributed to the stock's decline.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Market Volatility**: The relatively low trading volume on certain days could indicate increased volatility, making the stock more sensitive to short-term price changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Conclusion  \n",
       "\n",
       "Over the period from January 22 to February 5, Tesla stock experienced a net decline, reflecting various factors including earnings reports, market sentiment, geopolitical events, and corporate strategy. While the stock did not consistently rise, the overall performance indicates that Tesla faced challenges during this time, particularly on February 3 when the stock closed near its lowest price."
