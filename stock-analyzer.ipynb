    "# Data Analysis and Q&A Project Using a Local LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project requires you to perform a comprehensive analysis of a company's stock data using only the provided data sources and a local LLM. Your analysis should answer the following six questions strictly based on the supplied data and documents—no external data is allowed. All generated answers must be firmly based on the provided data, without any fabricated content. In addition, your logic must be clear, and any attribution of events must be causally linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Provided Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be provided with the following data sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stock Price Data (Json format)\n",
    "* Timeframe: Jan 22 to Feb 5\n",
    "* Fields: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quarterly Earnings Data for the Past Year (Json format)\n",
    "* Contains key financial indicators (e.g., revenue, eps) for each quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full Earnings Transcript Call\n",
    "* The complete transcript of the earnings call, including management discussions and Q&A.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balance Sheet Data for the Past Year (Json format)\n",
    "* Includes assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### News Articles\n",
    "* Full text of 10 news articles related to the company during the analysis period.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "Using the provided data and a local LLM, you need to answer the following six questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the performance of the Tesla stock during this period (Jan 22 to Feb 5)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why did the price increase on Jan 30? Please provide potential factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compared with previous quarters, how is the performance of this quarter?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With unsupervised Full Self Driving scheduled to launch in limited markets like Austin by June, what regulatory challenges does Tesla foresee for a nationwide or international rollout, and how is the company strategically preparing to address these hurdles?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What insights can be concluded from the earnings call?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Which key news events influenced the stock performance, and what insights do they offer?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Requirements\n",
    "- #### Data Source Restriction:\n",
    "Only use the provided data and documents. No external data or information is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Answer Generation:\n",
    "All generated answers must strictly be based on the provided data and documents. The LLM should not \"invent\" information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Clear Logic and Causal Relationships:\n",
    "For each question, your answers must clearly demonstrate logical reasoning, and any attribution of cause must be explicitly linked to events in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Prompt Design:\n",
    "You must design your own prompts for calling the local LLM to ensure that the responses are generated strictly based on the analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Result Evaluation:\n",
    "After generating the answers, implement an evaluation step to assess whether the responses meet the above requirements in terms of data reliance, logical clarity, and correct causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Please put the answers to these 6 questions in a dict at the end of your submitted Python nodebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "```code\n",
    "{ \"Q1 answer\": \"Answer1\", \"Q2 answer\": \"Answer2\", \"Q3 answer\": \"Answer3\", \"Q4 answer4\": \"Answer4\", \"Q5 answer\": \"Answer5\", \"Q6 answer\": \"Answer6\"}\n",
